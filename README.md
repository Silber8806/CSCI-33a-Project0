# CSCI-S-33a - Web Programming with Python and JS

The website is composed of 4 pages showcasing 4 different concepts:
1. Basic HTML -> this shows you ordered lists, unordered lists and tables.  Note the unique CSS.
2. Media Query -> an example of a media query adjusting to smart phones when resized.
3. Bootstrap examples -> shows 2-column, 3-column staggered and 3-column with Bootstrap cards.
4. SCSS example -> shows SCSS being compiled to CSS.  Where the SCSS is syntax highlighting for SCSS.

What files to look at for the above:
1. Basic HTML -> basic.html and styles.css (see CSS rules here)
2. Media Query -> media.html and media.css (contains media query)
3. Bootstrap examples -> bootstrap.html and supporting CDNS
4. SCSS example -> scss.html, scss.scss (pre-compiled SASS) and scss.css (compiled css)

Some notes about each section regarding sources:
1. Basic HTML -> I based this on memory as this is pretty easy.  Googled a bit on W3C schools for selectors.
2. Media Query -> Googled something on W3C schools and added my own CSS properties.
3. Bootstrap examples -> I went to the official tutorial, repurposed the navbar and copied 3 examples from the tutorial.  I then modified them to make them unique.
4. SCSS example -> I went through the tutorial really quickly, just repurposed them for syntax highlighting.

Think the above is good enough explanation.  Sorry I'm not that original regarding assignments.
